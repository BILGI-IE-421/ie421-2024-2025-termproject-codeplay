**We have chosen the Summer Olympics as the theme for our project. The three questions we selected to
explore are as follows:**
The Summer Olympics serve not only as a stage for athletic competitions but also as an arena reflecting the
historical, economic, and political identities of nations. The United States, Germany, and Russia stand out as
three of the most successful countries in modern Olympic history, capturing attention with their medal counts and 
sporting achievements. Behind these successes lie not just athletic preparation but also traces of these countries' histories,
political events, and economic conditions. In this context, our study aims to analyze the Olympic achievements 
of the United States, Germany, and Russia, uncovering the dynamics behind their success.

To focus our research and provide depth, we selected the following three key questions:

**Question-1**: How do the medal counts of the United States, Russia, and Germany differ?
This question aims to compare the overall medal performances of these three nations to identify 
which has demonstrated more consistent success. International platforms like the Olympic Games are 
not merely showcases of athletic ability but also reflect a nation’s economic strength and sports infrastructure.
This comparison provides a foundation for evaluating the impact of sports policies and the sustainability of success 
across these countries. Furthermore, it sets the stage for exploring how political boycotts, economic crises,
and shifts in international relations have influenced disparities in medal counts throughout Olympic history.


**Question-2 :** In which sports do the United States, Russia, and Germany , and what are the disciplines where they win the most medals?
The sports in which each country excels shed light on their historical and cultural contexts. 
Understanding which sports these nations prioritize and how these achievements result from strategic planning or infrastructure investments will help
uncover the varying approaches behind Olympic success.

**Question-3 :** How have the Summer Olympic medal counts of the United States, Germany, and Russia changed over time, 
The Olympics have long been a stage where the impacts of global political and social events are vividly observed. For example, the Cold War rivalry between the United States and Russia was reflected not only in politics but also in the sporting arena. How did Germany's division and reunification influence its Olympic performance? What effects did the boycotts of the 1980 Moscow Olympics and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics have on medal counts? This question aims to explore how historical events have intersected with athletic performance at the Olympics. It also delves into how political and economic transformations have shaped the dynamics of international sports.


The rationale behind selecting these questions lies in the belief that the Olympics are more than just a sporting event—they are a reflection of a nation's social, and political circumstances. Our study seeks to uncover the historical and political contexts behind the achievements of these three countries, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex framework underpinning the international sports arena.
