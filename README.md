**We have chosen the Summer Olympics as the theme for our project. The three questions we selected to
explore are as follows:**

**Question-1**: Do host countries win more medals in the Olympics compared to when they are not the host?
We chose this question to examine the impact of hosting the Olympics on a country's sporting success. We
believe that host countries might have an advantage due to factors like home crowd support, familiar
environments, and increased investments during the preparation phase. In this study, we aim to analyze
historical Olympic medal data to determine whether hosting truly makes a difference in medal counts.
Additionally, we will investigate how the number of athletes and preparation budgets of host countries
contribute to their success. This research aims to highlight the sporting benefits of hosting the Olympics and
provide insights for future strategic planning by countries.

**Question-2 :** How is the number of medals won by countries related to their GDP per capita?
The purpose of asking this question is to examine the impact of countries' economic power on sporting
success. The relationship between Olympic medal counts and per capita income helps us understand how
economic prosperity influences investments in sports. Wealthy countries generally have better facilities,
training opportunities, and resources to support their athletes, while in lower-income countries, geographic or
cultural advantages may play a role in success. By analyzing this relationship through data, we aim to see
how economic conditions affect medal counts. Using population data, we can also fairly compare the
performances of large and small countries. This analysis provides a foundation for understanding the extent
of economic inequalities in sports. Additionally, we can observe the strategies of countries at different
income levels and the outcomes of these strategies. This study helps us understand real-world issues through
data. While evaluating Olympic medal performances, we can better comprehend the influence of economic
and social factors in sports. Ultimately, understanding how economic power relates to sporting success is
significant and valuable for our project.

**Question-3 :** How do the economic growth rates of host countries change after the Olympics?
The purpose of asking this question is to understand the economic impacts of hosting the Olympics on a
country or city. Host countries typically make significant infrastructure investments before the Games and
aim to boost tourism. However, we want to analyze how much these investments contribute to economic
growth using data analysis. Post-Olympic economic growth rates allow us to evaluate the long-term benefits
gained by host nations. This question helps us understand how major events affect tourism revenues,
employment, and overall economic activity. By analyzing data, we can measure whether the spending by
host nations effectively translates into economic growth. Such an analysis highlights the advantages and
disadvantages of hosting the Olympics. It also provides insights into why some cities choose to bid for
hosting rights while others don’t. Through this study, we aim to clarify the relationship between economic
growth and Olympic expenditures. In the context of our data analysis course, this question serves as an
important example of using real-world data to derive concrete insights.
